# WorkDaySchedular
I created a work day schedular that functions to display the current time and when you scroll, you will find the standard buisness hours in timeblocks. When an event is in the past, present or future, then the timeblocks indicate so with diffrent colours. When an event is saved using the save button, then that event is saved in Local Storage and even when the page is refreshed that the event is still there.
